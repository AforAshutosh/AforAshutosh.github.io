Are you tired of seeing the same minimalist, clean designs everywhere you look? Well, get ready for a change because I believe that neo-brutalism is going to be everywhere in 2023.</p><p>But wait, you might be thinking, &ldquo;Neo-brutalism? Isn&rsquo;t that the rough, raw, and unrefined architectural style from the 1950s and 60s?&rdquo; And you&rsquo;re right, that is the original definition of brutalism. But in the world of web design, neo-brutalism refers to a style that embraces raw, unpolished elements like bold typography, rough textures, and limited color palettes.</p><p>One of the reasons I believe we&rsquo;ll be seeing more neo-brutalism in 2023 is the rise of nostalgia in design. As we move further into the digital age, there&rsquo;s a growing desire to reconnect with the past and to embrace the tactile and imperfect. Neo-brutalism taps into this nostalgia by harkening back to a time when design was less about perfection and more about raw expression.</p><p>Another reason is the desire for authenticity in design. In a world where everything is curated and filtered, people are craving designs that feel real and genuine. Neo-brutalism embraces this authenticity by embracing the imperfections and embracing the roughness of the design. It&rsquo;s a style that doesn&rsquo;t try to hide its flaws, but instead embraces them as part of its charm.</p><p>But let&rsquo;s not forget about the practical side of things. Neo-brutalism is a style that is easy to replicate and highly customizable. It&rsquo;s a style that can be adapted to a wide range of designs and can be used in a variety of ways, from bold and powerful to simple and understated.</p><p>Now, I know that some of you might be thinking, &ldquo;But what about accessibility? Won&rsquo;t neo-brutalism make it harder for people with disabilities to use my website?&rdquo; And you&rsquo;re right, it&rsquo;s important to consider accessibility in all of our designs. But neo-brutalism doesn&rsquo;t have to be inaccessible. By choosing appropriate color contrasts and typography, and ensuring that all functionality is still operable via keyboard, we can create neo-brutalist designs that are accessible to all users.</p><p>All that being said, I&rsquo;m not saying that every website in 2023 will be neo-brutalist, but I do believe that we&rsquo;ll start to see more and more of it. Neo-brutalism is a style that taps into our nostalgia and desire for authenticity, and it&rsquo;s a style that is easy to replicate and highly customizable. So, let&rsquo;s embrace the imperfections and the raw elements, and see how we can incorporate neo-brutalism into our designs in 2023.</p></article></article></main><footer><div class=content-container><div class=content><p>Hi.
