Are you tired of seeing the same minimalist, clean designs everywhere you look? Well, get ready for a change because I believe that neo-brutalism is going to be everywhere in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait, you might be thinking, &amp;ldquo;Neo-brutalism? Isn&amp;rsquo;t that the rough, raw, and unrefined architectural style from the 1950s and 60s?&amp;rdquo; And you&amp;rsquo;re right, that is the original definition of brutalism. But in the world of web design, neo-brutalism refers to a style that embraces raw, unpolished elements like bold typography, rough textures, and limited color palettes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I believe we&amp;rsquo;ll be seeing more neo-brutalism in 2023 is the rise of nostalgia in design. As we move further into the digital age, there&amp;rsquo;s a growing desire to reconnect with the past and to embrace the tactile and imperfect. Neo-brutalism taps into this nostalgia by harkening back to a time when design was less about perfection and more about raw expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason is the desire for authenticity in design. In a world where everything is curated and filtered, people are craving designs that feel real and genuine. Neo-brutalism embraces this authenticity by embracing the imperfections and embracing the roughness of the design. It&amp;rsquo;s a style that doesn&amp;rsquo;t try to hide its flaws, but instead embraces them as part of its charm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let&amp;rsquo;s not forget about the practical side of things. Neo-brutalism is a style that is easy to replicate and highly customizable. It&amp;rsquo;s a style that can be adapted to a wide range of designs and can be used in a variety of ways, from bold and powerful to simple and understated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I know that some of you might be thinking, &amp;ldquo;But what about accessibility? Won&amp;rsquo;t neo-brutalism make it harder for people with disabilities to use my website?&amp;rdquo; And you&amp;rsquo;re right, it&amp;rsquo;s important to consider accessibility in all of our designs. But neo-brutalism doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be inaccessible. By choosing appropriate color contrasts and typography, and ensuring that all functionality is still operable via keyboard, we can create neo-brutalist designs that are accessible to all users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that being said, I&amp;rsquo;m not saying that every website in 2023 will be neo-brutalist, but I do believe that we&amp;rsquo;ll start to see more and more of it. Neo-brutalism is a style that taps into our nostalgia and desire for authenticity, and it&amp;rsquo;s a style that is easy to replicate and highly customizable. So, let&amp;rsquo;s embrace the imperfections and the raw elements, and see how we can incorporate neo-brutalism into our designs in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Ssr Should Be Default</title><link>https://ashutoshsinghrawat.com/posts/ssr-should-be-default/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jan 2023 23:08:25 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://ashutoshsinghrawat.com/posts/ssr-should-be-default/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Hey there fellow developers! If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, you&amp;rsquo;re always on the lookout for the latest and greatest technologies and trends in web development. And one trend that I&amp;rsquo;ve been seeing more and more of lately (well, a few years now..) is the use of server-side rendering (SSR) for web applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I know that some of you may be thinking, &amp;ldquo;But wait, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using single-page applications (SPAs) for years and they&amp;rsquo;ve worked just fine!&amp;rdquo; And you&amp;rsquo;re right, SPAs have been a popular choice for web development for a while now. But as technology and user needs have evolved, I think it&amp;rsquo;s time for us to start thinking about SSR as the default for web applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Are Single Page applications dead?</title><link>https://ashutoshsinghrawat.com/posts/are-single-page-applications-dead/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jan 2023 22:59:34 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://ashutoshsinghrawat.com/posts/are-single-page-applications-dead/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Single page applications, or SPAs, have been a popular choice for web development for several years. However, as technology and user needs have evolved, the death of SPAs has been predicted by some in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main reasons for this prediction is the rise of mobile devices and the need for faster loading times. SPAs rely on JavaScript to load and render content, which can be slow and clunky on mobile devices with limited processing power. Additionally, Google and other search engines have had difficulty indexing the content on SPAs, making it difficult for users to find them through search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason for the decline of SPAs is the emergence of new technologies such as Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) and server-side rendering (SSR). PWAs are web applications that can be installed on a user&amp;rsquo;s device and work offline, providing a similar experience to native mobile apps. SSR allows for the rendering of web pages on the server, reducing the load on the client&amp;rsquo;s device and improving the performance of web pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, SPAs can also be difficult to maintain and update, since all the code is bundled into one large JavaScript file. This makes it harder to identify and fix bugs, and can also lead to longer development times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that being said, Single Page Applications are not dead. They are still widely used, and they can be useful in certain cases, such as when building a web application that requires a lot of client-side logic or when you need a fast and responsive user interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it&amp;rsquo;s also important to keep in mind that SPAs are not the best solution for all use cases. For example, if you&amp;rsquo;re building a content-heavy website, it may be more beneficial to use traditional server-side rendering to improve search engine optimization and reduce the load on the client&amp;rsquo;s device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, it&amp;rsquo;s important for developers to evaluate the specific needs of their project and choose the appropriate technology for the job. While SPAs have been a popular choice for web development in the past, the rise of new technologies and changing user needs mean that they may not be the best option for every project. It&amp;rsquo;s important to stay aware of the latest developments in web development and to choose the solution that best meets the needs of your project.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Imagining The Future</title><link>https://ashutoshsinghrawat.com/posts/imagining-the-future/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Feb 2016 10:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://ashutoshsinghrawat.com/posts/imagining-the-future/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Views on how consumer technology will change in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change in technology is not new. Every couple of years, we see something new in technology that improves on something already cherished. Every couple of decades or so, we see technology changing as a whole. Those of you who know about the Koomey&amp;rsquo;s or Moore&amp;rsquo;s Law and Intel&amp;rsquo;s Tic and Tock know what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about. In the five years since, I have had the pleasure to use many mobile operating systems, command Google Glass to take pictures for me, instruct Leap Motion (à la Minority Report), look like an idiot enjoying a VR Headset, fly/crash a Quadcopter (I own one, still cant figure out how to fly that thing), track my health with a fitness tracker, or read Malcolm Gladwell on an E book Reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because technology is there, doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it is for everyone (Big Data); doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it has matured (VR); and definitely doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that it is always useful (Smart Appliances/Bad IoT, 3D TV&amp;rsquo;s). As a person with lackluster memory (a consumer), I thank my Smartphone for remembering the phone number of my 20th best friend so that I can grant him a customary birthday greeting once a year. Even though I consider myself satisfactorily techie, a smartphone and a laptop is all I need to continue with my work and personal other worldly pleasures. For me, no tablet can provide me the convenience of calling, SMS, messaging, and casual Facebook/YouTube surfing in a pocket-sized device that my smartphone can. No smartwatch or fitness tracker currently in market can replace my no-fuss Seiko watch that is ready to show date and time and bear the optimum weight on my wrist for years at stretch, without a recharge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last five years of my gadget self discovery, I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced many patterns that I think, will hold true in the future. What will my gadget future look like? If you are anything like me, chances are it will be the same for you too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Previce — Primary Device.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While enjoying the morning sun, I savor the perfect Chai and read headlines that will get me ready for the day. My job requires me to be updated on the current trends in technology and I don&amp;rsquo;t like being distracted with news and articles throughout the day. My Previce, now resized to a comfortable 10″ size for reading, knows that. It carefully curates, prioritizes, and summarizes just the right amount of news I&amp;rsquo;d read in the leisure time I have before I begin my fitness regime. My Previce is perfect. It knows all my preferences and makes sure I get the right user experience from the world around me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I begin my fitness regime with some yoga exercises. Previce selects the type of exercises I do based on my latest body vitals and coaches me through the training while all along tracking my vitals. In its 5″ form, tied to my armband, it can track all the vitals it needs. In the last month, it has recommended yoga, strength training, and endurance training based on my vitals and health goals set by my physician. Previce is clever. It also communicates with the Previce of my doctor, spouse, co-workers, and friends and keeps us all connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now ready to leave for the office, my Previce communicates with my car and sends my destination in advance. I must clarify its not my car, it is an autonomous service to which I have subscribed. The car automatically comes in front of my house just before I am ready to leave for the office. It drives me to the office while I read emails from work. After dropping me off, it goes to pick up another person who has subscribed to the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My inbox, crazier than ever, is easier to manage. Previce has changed it for the better. It automatically segregates the spam, fills forms, accepts meeting requests, marks emails as read, and manages my calendar to make sure I only read the emails meant for me. By communicating with all my co-worker&amp;rsquo;s Previces and the different services, it books conference rooms and can also make restaurant reservations on my behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previce is a powerful device now that it is connected to my 24″ display glass with motion sensing, video, and J.A.R.V.I.S (à la Iron Man) like AI audio inputs commands. On my desk, where I work on anything from casual internet research, and creating presentations to photo editing, and video creation — it can wirelessly utilize parallel computing to provide me the computing power I need, on-demand. Everything is in the cloud so I can take my work with me wherever necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I wrap up my workday before I meet my family for the dinner reservation that my Previce suggested, I wonder how easy, efficient, simple and yet somewhat eerie my life is with Previce at the helm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can Previce Be Real?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all intents and purposes, Previce is real. Technology existing in 2016 allows us to create such a device. As previously stated, great consumer technology is not necessary a result of an invention but innovation in piecing the right inventions together and providing it with a lucrative businesses model. Previce is an imagination of a personal gadget that is less about technology and more about utility, user experience, and coherent technology solutions that work well together. If brought to reality, it would do a more than I can imagine or write. If I were to play an oracle, in the next five years, the smartphone will evolve to become a Previce-like device. As different industries evolve with technology, apps and smartphones will create an ecosystem capable enough to create the future I imagine for myself.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
